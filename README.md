### Build

Jekyll enables you to build and run a local copy of the site which automatically refreshes on every change. To do this, run the following command:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

Then, you can access the site via `http://localhost:4000`.

You can also test a local copy on other devices (such as phones or tablets) by using this command:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

Then, you can access the site via `http://<your-local-ip>:4000`.
