# Deep Mud

**Deep Mud** is a sinking mud based on the vanilla Minecraft mud block. It is significantly easier to escape than [Mire]({% link pages/mire.md %}).

## Generation

Deep Mud generates in mangrove swamps as large, misshapen pits at or close to water level, with mangrove trees growing over its surface. Some plants, such as lilypads and duckweed, grow across its surface in small bunches.

## Sinking

Deep Mud is primarily composed of mangrove trees' organic matter, making it a little bit easier to navigate than [Mire]({% link pages/mire.md %}).

Deep Mud comes in a normal and thick variety, with the thicker one being slower to sink in.

## Usage

Just like vanilla Minecraft's mud blocks, Deep Mud can be used to craft mud bricks.
