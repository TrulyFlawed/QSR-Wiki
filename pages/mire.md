**Mire** is a sinking mud based on the vanilla Minecraft dirt block, taking on a more wet and smooth appearance. It is fairly dense, heavy, and sticky. It is more difficult to escape than [Deep Mud]({% link pages/mud.md %})

## Generation

It generates in swamps, oak/dark oak/birch/spruce forests, and plains. Mire can be found in small to moderate-sized, standalone pits, with grass blades growing across its surface in small bunches.

A given mire pit is made of the following blocks:

- Mire — The base substance; has faster sinking than thick mire.
- Thick mire — A substance that one sinks into more slowly than standard mire.
- Soft dirt — Thick mire with a dirt texture as camouflage.
- Wet grass — Thick mire with a grass texture as camouflage.

## Sinking

It is a fairly dense, earthy substance, which makes movements quite slow. It is moderately difficult to escape.
