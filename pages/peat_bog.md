# Peat Bog

A **Peat Bog** is a bog with a thick layer of moss on the surface, which decays into a dark brown, clumpy mud underneath. It is commonly found around rivers, lakes, and ponds.

## Generation

Peat Bogs can be found in plains, swamps, and riverbanks neighboring with plains.

They can generate in two ways:

1. As large, standalone pits, with Mossy Peat Bog covering most of the surface, but with small patches of exposed Peat Bog closer to the middle.
2. Long, wide, and flat patches of Mossy Peat Bog surrounding rivers or lakes, stretching alongside the shore, with small patches of exposed Peat Bog in the middle.

Oak and birch trees grow sporadically at the edges of a pit; Tall reeds, cattails, and long grass blades growing closer to the outer edges; shorter grass, cranberry bushes, and duckweed growing closer to the middle; plain Mossy Peat Bog and exposed Peat Bog in the middle.

## Sinking

Decaying peat produces more dense mass than leaves, which makes Peat Bogs slightly more thick and dense than [Forest Bogs]({% link pages/bog.md %}). Peat bogs are soft and light, clumpy in texture, and not too sticky, which makes it both easy to sink into and easy to escape.

Peat Bogs are unstable, but Mossy Peat Bogs are safe to run, walk, stand, and jump on top of. Though jumping too much on Mossy Peat Bogs might result in the moss giving way to a the Peat Bog below it.
