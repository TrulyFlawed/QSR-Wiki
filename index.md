# Welcome to the Quicksand Rehydrated Wiki!

Welcome to the wiki for [Quicksand Rehydrated]({% link pages/quicksand-rehydrated.md %}), where anyone can contribute via the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Rehydrated-Labs/rehydrated-labs.github.io). The mod is still early in development, and in need of contributors. The developers host a [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/RmpR94fXTb) for anyone who wants to contribute or keep track of the mod's progress.

## Companion mods

The mod currently has four planned companion mods beyond Quicksand Rehydrated:

- [Quicksand Core]({% link pages/quicksand-core.md %}) — A more modpack-friendly version of QSR with terrain-themed hazards & structrues and [Hunnibees]({% link pages/hunnibees.md %}).
- [Quicksand Glacéed]({% link pages/quicksand-glaceed.md %}) — An addon that includes a candy world dimension and expands QSR's optional content.
- Quicksand Laboratory — Adds an industrial structure similar to Minecraft's stronghold, which has new resources, machines, and hazards.
- Quicksand Carnivores — Adds a wider variety of mobs to the game.
